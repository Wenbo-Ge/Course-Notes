//Java Note:

Run java in cmd, need to run cmd in adminstor, or it may not work
type cd c:\(need disk name) to locate the dirctory
first need to compile the JavaMain.java file,
second need to run java, java JavaMain (dont need to include .class)


//Java lab

when declare the variable with public:
public int time = 10;
then for the method function should start with public (start with public static will have conflicts):
public void displayCar() {
		System.out.print("Plate is " + plate + " with time of " + time + ", velocity is " + velocity);
	}


Java class structure:

public class Car {

//constructors
  public Car (String pl) {
  //initilization 
  plate = pl;
  }
  
//methods

//void means no need to return datatype
public void displayCar() {
		System.out.print("Plate is " + plate + " with time of " + time + ", velocity is " + velocity);
	}
// no void means need to return datatype
public double calcAcceleration () {
		return accleration =  velocity /  time;
	}

// main
public static void main(String[] args) {

  }
}
