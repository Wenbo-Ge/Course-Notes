# Java Note:

	Run java in cmd, need to run cmd in adminstor, or it may not work
	type cd c:\(need disk name) to locate the dirctory
	first need to compile the JavaMain.java file,
	second need to run java, java JavaMain (dont need to include .class)


# Java Ideas
	Use variables in the method, then in other class main method, instaniate other class object and use new object to call methods 		from other classes

	In Class One to call Class Two static method, can directly call Two.method(), no need to new object since it is static

# static to non-staic error

	class A{  
	 int a=40;//non static  

	 public static void main(String args[]){  
	  System.out.println(a);  // System.out.println is static method, so will have error, create an instance, then it will work
	 }  
	}     


# Java class structure:

	public class Car {

	//constructors
	  public Car (String pl) {
	  //initilization 
	  plate = pl;
	  }

	//methods always with prentsise

	//void means no need to return datatype
	public void displayCar() {
			System.out.print("Plate is " + plate + " with time of " + time + ", velocity is " + velocity);
		}
	// no void means need to return datatype
	public double calcAcceleration () {
			return accleration =  velocity /  time;
		}

	// main
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	  }
	}
	
# Scanner 
	Scanner is class.
	
# Constructor
	A constructor has the same name as the class name

# Java static VS instance variable (give default value to variable).
	instance variable: String Name = '';

# Java file name and class name
	When changing the file name, should also change the class name, or file will not complile
	
# Java decimal formatting
	http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-internationalization/decimalformat.html
	
# formating
	System.out.printf ("%10s|", "");
	//prinf
	%f for double/float => %10.2f
	%d for integer
	%s for String
	%n for newline
	
# Java variables
	String str; this is the object, default value is null, so no memories.
	int a ; this is primitive, default value is 0. memory is allocated.
	int _test, $test are okay to compile but not recommended!
	
# Java private variable vs pulic variable
	class One {
		private String content; // private variable cannot be directly used in other class, but can put variable into public 			method then called by other classes
		public void display () {
			content = "aa"
		} // private can be used in pulic method then method can be called in other classes
	}
	class Two {
		One call = new One();
		sysout.print(call.content) // this won't work because of private variable
		call.display() //will work becasue of pulic method
	}
	
# SQL deleting and dropping order:
	child is frist then parent (in terms of foreign key)

# java else if:
	Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

	if (condition1) {
	  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
	} else if (condition2) {
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
	} else {
	  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
	}

# java casting:
	small to large will be automated converted: 5 to "5" 
	large to small must use conversion Double.parse("")

# java field vs variable:
	Field is a data member of a class. A field is non static, non-transient instance variable. Field is generally a private variable 	on an instance class. Variables are comprised of fields and non-fields

# Data type:
	primitive: 8
	reference: start with upper case like String
	void means not in two types

JAVA Sort OBJECTS BY PROPERTIES

Override compareTo Method
The compareTo method defines the natural order; the default way for ordering objects of a class.
It should return a negative integer(usually -1), if the current triggering object is less than the passed one, and positive integer (usually +1) if greater than, and 0 if equal.
public int compareTo(File b){ 
    if(this.name > b.name) return 1; 
    if(this.name < b.name) return -1;
    else                   return 0;
}
