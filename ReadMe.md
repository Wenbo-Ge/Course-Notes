# static to non-staic error

	class A{  
	 int a=40;//non static  

	 public static void main(String args[]){  
	  System.out.println(a);  // System.out.println is static method, so will have error, create an instance, then it will work
	 }  
	}     


# Java class structure:

	public class Car {

	//constructors
	  public Car (String pl) {
	  //initilization 
	  plate = pl;
	  }

	//methods always with prentsise

	//void means no need to return datatype
	public void displayCar() {
			System.out.print("Plate is " + plate + " with time of " + time + ", velocity is " + velocity);
		}
	// no void means need to return datatype
	public double calcAcceleration () {
			return accleration =  velocity /  time;
		}

	// main
	public static void main(String[] args) {

	  }
